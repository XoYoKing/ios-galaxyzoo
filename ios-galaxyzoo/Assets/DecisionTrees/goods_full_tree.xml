    <title>Shape</title>
    <text>Is the galaxy simply smooth and rounded, with no sign of a disk?</text>
    <help>The aim here is to divide featureless galaxies from all the rest. If you can see any interesting features at all, click "features or disk." Just occasionally you might see something that isn't a galaxy at all - the long streak of a satellite, for example, or a image swamped by light from a bright star. If this happens, just click "star or artifact". Click to see larger images.</help>

    <title>Round</title>
    <text>How rounded is it?</text>
    <help>Not all galaxies are perfectly round - just look at the overall shape and put it in one of these three categories. If there's more than one galaxy in the field, remember always to concentrate on the one in the centre. Click to see larger images.</help>

    <title>Bulge</title>
    <text>Does the galaxy have a bulge at its center? If so, what shape?</text>
    <help>Concentrate on the centre of the galaxy - if it has a smooth, uninterrupted, needle or lens-shape then click "no bulge." Otherwise your options are "rounded" bulge or "boxy" (but boxy bulges are rare). Click to see larger images.</help>

    <title>Bar</title>

    <title>Bulge</title>
