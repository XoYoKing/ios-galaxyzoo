*** Translating the app

We use Transifex, who generously support open-source projects.
Please visit our Transifex page to create or correct translations for your
language:
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/android-galaxyzoo/


There are some sample screenshots here to help you to understand the context:

*** Translating the website, to complete the app translation

The questions are not in the app itself.

Even if your language already has a translation of the website/decision-tree,
you might look at that translation to decide what terminology to use when
translating the app.

You can provide a translation of the
Galaxy Zoo website that the app will then use, via:
http://translations.zooniverse.org/

Previously these questions were in the Galaxy-Zoo github repository,
so you might still find clues for your language's translation there:
For instance:
https://github.com/zooniverse/Galaxy-Zoo/tree/master/public/locales
though the most recent translations now seem to be here instead:
http://www.galaxyzoo.org/locales/LOCALE.json
For instance:
http://www.galaxyzoo.org/locales/fr.json

From those files, we use the translations of the "Decision Tree":
https://github.com/zooniverse/Galaxy-Zoo/blob/master/app/lib/sloan_tree.coffee
