# CocoaPods
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control
#
# murrayc: I disagree. I don't want to fork the code of dependencies and I don't want to deal with the conflicts
# that it would cause when we do merge, rebase or cherry-pick.
